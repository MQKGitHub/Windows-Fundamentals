## 🌐 Windows Fundamentals  

This section of my TryHackMe journey focuses on getting hands-on access to Windows and its security controls. These basics will help you in identifying, exploiting, and defending Windows systems.

Each room builds on the last, helping me develop essential Windows skills, learn about Windows security, and interact with Windows systems through practical tasks.
